      Here is each of our thoughts on our project.
    </p> 

      <h3>Elizabeth Enloe: Lead Programmer</h3>
      <p>I thought going through this project was a fun experience, aside from the stress of it being a final project. I had a blast creating a make-shift record player from scratch using coding and learning how to upload it to an actual website. The best part was definitely hearing the final result - it was so rewarding!</p>
    <h3>Stephanie Gutierrez:Lead Fabrication/Artist</h3>
      <p> This project was a very fun process. As a group we were able to work well and were lucky enough that our ideas and goals aligned perfeclty which allowed us to get started almost immediately. Getting to work with the Makey Makey was interesting and was a great project to get us working creatively, I hope to find more inspiration and find ways to improve this project even further. For the project I contributed through the fabrication of the physical material as well as the web design html coding.  </p>
       <h3>Truc Dong</h3>
      <p> I gained additional knowledge about Javascript programming after finishing the project. Furthermore, I gained knowledge on how to enhance programming's appeal and allow it to interact with objects directly rather than via a keyboard. Furthermore, this project teaches me about a wide range of programming-based interactions. Through this effort, I also learned a wide variety of songs. </p>
