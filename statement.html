      Here is each of our thoughts on our project.
    </p> 

      <h3>Elizabeth Enloe</h3>
      <p>I thought going through this project was a fun experience, aside from the stress of it being a final project. I had a blast creating a make-shift record player from scratch using coding and learning how to upload it to an actual website. The best part was definitely hearing the final result - it was so rewarding!</p>

      <p> I gained additional knowledge about Javascript programming after finishing the project. Furthermore, I gained knowledge on how to enhance programming's appeal and allow it to interact with objects directly rather than via a keyboard. Furthermore, this project teaches me about a wide range of programming-based interactions. Through this effort, I also learned a wide variety of songs. </p>
